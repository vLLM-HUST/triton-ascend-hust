# Triton-Ascend Autotune Guide

## Positioning

This guide is intended for users who already know how to write Triton kernels and already understand the basic concepts of community `triton.autotune`. It focuses on the recommended Triton-Ascend usage:

- the recommended autotune usage on Triton-Ascend;
- what `configs=[]` means on the Ascend backend;
- when automatic tiling is a good fit, and when you should fall back to handwritten `triton.Config`.

## Recommended Usage

On Triton-Ascend, the recommended usage is to keep the community-style `@triton.autotune` interface and set `configs` to `[]` when you want the backend to generate and evaluate candidate configurations automatically:

```python
"""
Vector Add
=============
"""


import torch
import torch_npu
import triton
import triton.language as tl
import triton.backends.ascend.runtime
from triton.backends.ascend.testing import do_bench_npu


@triton.autotune(configs=[], key=["n_elements"])
@triton.jit
def add_kernel(x_ptr,  # *Pointer* to first input vector.
               y_ptr,  # *Pointer* to second input vector.
               output_ptr,  # *Pointer* to output vector.
               n_elements,  # Size of the vector.
               BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr,  # Number of elements each program should process.
               # NOTE: `constexpr` so it can be used as a shape value.
               ):
    # There are multiple 'programs' processing different data. We identify which program
    # we are here:
    pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)  # We use a 1D launch grid so axis is 0.
    # This program will process inputs that are offset from the initial data.
    # For instance, if you had a vector of length 256 and block_size of 64, the programs
    # would each access the elements [0:64, 64:128, 128:192, 192:256].
    # Note that offsets is a list of pointers:
    block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE
    offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)
    # Create a mask to guard memory operations against out-of-bounds accesses.
    mask = offsets < n_elements
    # Load x and y from DRAM, masking out any extra elements in case the input is not a
    # multiple of the block size.
    x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)
    y = tl.load(y_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)
    output = x + y
    # Write x + y back to DRAM.
    tl.store(output_ptr + offsets, output, mask=mask)


def add_torch(x, y):
    return x + y


def add_autotune(x, y):
    output = torch.empty_like(x)
    n_elements = output.numel()
    add_kernel[lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(n_elements, meta["BLOCK_SIZE"]), )](x, y, output, n_elements)
    return output


def test_add(size: int):
    x = torch.rand(size, device="npu")
    y = torch.rand(size, device="npu")

    output_torch = add_torch(x, y)
    output_triton = add_autotune(x, y)
    assert torch.allclose(output_triton, output_torch)
    print(f"Vector Add {size} PASSED!")
    triton_us = do_bench_npu(lambda: add_autotune(x, y))
    torch_us = do_bench_npu(lambda: add_torch(x, y))
    print(f"Triton kernel execution time: {triton_us:.4f} ms")
    print(f"PyTorch kernel execution time: {torch_us:.4f} ms")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_add(98432)

```

This means:

- `key` has the same semantics as in community Triton and determines which runtime-input changes trigger re-selection of a configuration;
- `configs=[]` on Triton-Ascend means "let the Ascend backend generate candidate configurations and tune them", not "there are no configurations".

## Prerequisites

### 1. Enable the Ascend autotune extension first

Only after importing the following line will Triton-Ascend enter the autotune extension path:

```python
import triton.backends.ascend.runtime
```

Without this step, you are still using the community `triton.autotune`, and `configs=[]` does not trigger Ascend automatic tiling.

### 2. `@triton.autotune` must wrap `@triton.jit` directly

It must be written in the following order:

```python
@triton.autotune(configs=[], key=["M", "N"])
@triton.jit
def kernel(...):
    ...
```

`@triton.autotune` must wrap `@triton.jit` directly, and no other decorator should be inserted between them. Otherwise, the kernel DSL may not be parsed correctly, and Triton-Ascend may fail to enter the automatic-tiling generation and tuning path.

### 3. `key` has the same meaning as in community Triton

`key` is effectively the autotune cache key. Any parameter included in `key` triggers autotune again when its value changes.

In most cases, `key` contains shape parameters such as `M/N/K`, `seq_len`, or `hidden_size`, because they often have a significant impact on the optimal tiling choice. However, `key` is not limited to shape parameters. If another parameter affects configuration selection, it can also be included in `key`.

### 4. Do not fix parameters that should participate in automatic tuning too early

If you want a `tl.constexpr` parameter to participate in automatic tiling generation, all of the following must be true:

- it must be a tiling parameter, meaning that it affects how much data each block processes or how tile sizes are formed;
- it must not be fixed explicitly in the launch call;
- it must not have a default value in the kernel definition.

For example, in the following code, `BLOCK_M` participates in automatic tuning:

```python
kernel[grid](
    x,
    y,
    out,
    M,
    N,
)
```

If you explicitly pass:

```python
kernel[grid](
    x,
    y,
    out,
    M,
    N,
    BLOCK_M=128,
)
```

then the parameter is already fixed and is no longer part of the automatic-generation space.

Likewise, if a tunable parameter is given a default value in the kernel definition, for example:

```python
@triton.jit
def kernel(
    ...,
    BLOCK_M: tl.constexpr = 128,
):
    ...
```

then the parameter does not participate in automatic tuning. For parameters that should be generated and tuned automatically by the framework, keep them as `tl.constexpr` parameters that are neither passed explicitly at launch time nor given default values in the kernel definition.

### 5. If a tiling parameter affects the grid, the grid must be written as a lambda

If a tiling parameter affects the grid size, the grid must not be written as a fixed value or a static expression that depends only on runtime parameters. Instead, it must be written as a `lambda` that depends on meta parameters, just as in community autotune.

```python
grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(M, meta["BLOCK_M"]),)
```

The reason is that when autotune evaluates different candidate configurations, parameters such as `BLOCK_M` change. If the grid does not change with the candidate configuration, Triton-Ascend cannot guarantee that each candidate is launched correctly.

## Practical Notes

The benchmark semantics are the same as in community autotune: the kernel may be executed multiple times. If the kernel has side effects, such as atomic operations, in-place writes, or accumulated modifications to input or output buffers, the existing community hook mechanism is still required.

## What Triton-Ascend Adds Beyond Community Autotune

The typical community `triton.autotune` workflow is that the user provides a set of handwritten `triton.Config` objects, the framework benchmarks them, and the best result is cached.

Triton-Ascend keeps the same usage style but extends it in several important ways.

### 1. Support for `configs=[]` to generate candidate configurations automatically

This is the core extension. Users do not have to handwrite a list of `triton.Config` objects up front. Instead, they can leave `configs` empty and let the Ascend backend generate candidate configurations from the kernel DSL semantics and runtime shapes.

### 2. Parallel compilation of multiple candidates

When autotune needs to evaluate multiple candidate configurations, Triton-Ascend compiles them in parallel by default to reduce first-tune latency.

This behavior is enabled by default and can be disabled with `TRITON_AUTOTUNE_PARALLEL_COMPILE=0`.

### 3. Support for profiler-based performance collection

Triton-Ascend supports switching the performance-collection method used during autotune benchmark. In addition to the default benchmark path, you can use profiler-based collection for each candidate configuration. This path focuses on on-chip execution time and is more accurate than the default method for short-running kernels, but it also increases autotune time. This feature can be enabled by setting `TRITON_BENCH_METHOD="npu"`.

## Scope and Behavior of Automatic Tiling Generation

The first extension above shows that Triton-Ascend supports automatic generation of candidate configurations with `configs=[]`. The following points further clarify the behavior of this capability.

### 1. Automatic generation focuses on tiling parameters

Automatic generation in Ascend focuses on tiling-related `tl.constexpr` parameters, that is, parameters that affect how much data each block processes or how tile sizes are formed.

This capability does not mean "automatically tune every parameter". Parameters such as `num_warps` and `num_stages`, as well as non-tiling kernel parameters, are outside the current automatic-generation scope.

### 2. Candidate configurations are filtered with Ascend hardware constraints

When generating candidates, the Ascend backend filters them using NPU-specific constraints such as on-chip memory capacity, alignment constraints, and core-utilization limits, instead of simply enumerating many configurations and benchmarking them blindly.

### 3. The goal of automatic tiling is to provide a reasonably good configuration

To balance tuning cost and tuning result quality, current automatic tiling prunes the candidate space heavily. As a result, the automatically generated result is not guaranteed to reach the upper bound of carefully hand-tuned performance.

The goal of this feature is to lower the usage barrier and tuning cost while making it easy to obtain a configuration with reasonably good performance.

### 4. When automatic tiling fails, users need handwritten `triton.Config`

If automatic tiling cannot generate any valid candidate configurations, you need to switch back to handwritten `triton.Config`. It is also recommended to file an issue for such cases so that Triton-Ascend can improve parsing and automatic-generation coverage later.

## Handwritten `triton.Config` Mode

If automatic tiling fails, or if the generated tiling result does not meet your performance target, you can return directly to the standard community-style handwritten configuration path. Triton-Ascend keeps this part of the interface compatible:

```python
@triton.autotune(
    configs=[
        triton.Config({"BLOCK_M": 128, "BLOCK_N": 128}),
        triton.Config({"BLOCK_M": 64, "BLOCK_N": 256}),
    ],
    key=["M", "N"],
)
@triton.jit
def kernel(...):
    ...
```

In this mode:

- configurations are defined explicitly by the user;
- the framework still handles benchmarking, best-config selection, and cache reuse;
- the usage pattern remains consistent with community Triton autotune.

### Inspecting Autotuning Logs

Set `TRITON_PRINT_AUTOTUNING=1` to view autotuning logs. When benchmarking completes, the output shows the tuning time, the best configuration, and the benchmark results for each successful configuration. The following output is illustrative (`...` indicates omitted configuration parameters):

```text
Triton autotuning for function kernel finished after 0.12s; best config selected: BLOCK_M: 128, BLOCK_N: 128, ...;
Triton autotuning benchmark results for function kernel:
  config=BLOCK_M: 128, BLOCK_N: 128, ...; p50=0.0100 ms, p20=0.0090 ms, p80=0.0110 ms [selected]
  config=BLOCK_M: 64, BLOCK_N: 256, ...; p50=0.0140 ms, p20=0.0130 ms, p80=0.0150 ms
```

`[selected]` marks the best configuration. `p50`, `p20`, and `p80` are the 50th, 20th, and 80th percentile execution times in milliseconds. If the benchmark returns a mean time, it is shown as `mean=... ms` instead.

If a user-provided configuration (`configs`, including configurations expanded through `hints`) fails, or an exception interrupts autotuning, the logs report the affected configuration's status and reason. The following examples illustrate a compilation failure and interrupted autotuning, respectively:

```text
Triton autotuning: config=BLOCK_M: 128, BLOCK_N: 128, ...; compile_failed; reason=CompileTimeAssertionFailure: <error message>
Triton autotuning: config=BLOCK_M: 64, BLOCK_N: 256, ...; not_evaluated; reason=No benchmark result was produced. Autotuning interrupted: RuntimeError: <error message>
```

Here, `compile_failed` indicates a compilation failure, `not_evaluated` means the configuration's evaluation did not complete, and `reason` describes the failure or interruption.

## Advanced Usage: Combine Automatic Tiling with Other Tunable Parameters

The following content is advanced usage and should only be considered when you want to continue tuning non-tiling kernel parameters or compilation parameters together with automatic tiling.

### 1. Community autotune: enumerate all tunable parameters manually

In the standard community style, users enumerate all candidate configurations manually:

```python
@triton.autotune(
    configs=[
        triton.Config(
            {
                "BLOCK_M": BM,
                "BLOCK_N": BN,
                "BLOCK_K": BK,
                "GROUP_SIZE_M": GS,
            },
            num_warps=num_warps,
        )
        for BM in [16, 32, 64]
        for BN in [16, 32, 64]
        for BK in [16, 32, 64]
        for GS in [1, 2, 4, 8]
        for num_warps in [1, 2, 4, 8]
    ],
    key=["M", "N", "K"],
)
@triton.jit
def matmul_kernel(a, b, M, N, K, BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N, BLOCK_K, GROUP_SIZE_M):
    ...
```

### 2. Triton-Ascend: enumerate tiling parameters and Ascend compilation parameters manually

In Triton-Ascend, if you still want to use manual enumeration, you can also put Ascend-side parameters into the handwritten configuration space:

```python
@triton.autotune(
    configs=[
        triton.Config(
            {
                "BLOCK_M": BM,
                "BLOCK_N": BN,
                "BLOCK_K": BK,
                "GROUP_SIZE_M": GS,
                "multibuffer": MS,
            }
        )
        for BM in [16, 32, 64]
        for BN in [16, 32, 64]
        for BK in [16, 32, 64]
        for GS in [1, 2, 4, 8]
        for MS in [False, True]
    ],
    key=["M", "N", "K"],
)
@triton.jit
def matmul_kernel(a, b, M, N, K, BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N, BLOCK_K, GROUP_SIZE_M):
    ...
```

### 3. Triton-Ascend: generate tiling automatically while tuning other parameters jointly

If you want tiling parameters to continue being generated automatically through `configs=[]`, but also want to tune additional non-tiling parameters or compilation parameters, you can pass those extra search dimensions through `hints`:

```python
@triton.autotune(
    configs=[],
    key=["M", "N", "K"],
    hints={
        "GROUP_SIZE_M": [1, 2, 4, 8],
        "multibuffer": [False, True],
    },
)
@triton.jit
def matmul_kernel(a, b, M, N, K, BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N, BLOCK_K, GROUP_SIZE_M):
    ...


grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(M, meta["BLOCK_M"]) * meta["GROUP_SIZE_M"], triton.cdiv(N, meta["BLOCK_N"]))
matmul_kernel[grid](a, b, M, N, K)
```

This means:

- tiling-related parameters are still generated automatically by Triton-Ascend;
- non-tiling parameters or compilation parameters (such as `GROUP_SIZE_M` and `multibuffer`) are provided explicitly by the user through `hints`;
- autotune evaluates the combined search space of both parts.

## Summary

The key extension of Triton-Ascend over community autotune is not a change in user-facing interfaces, but the addition of automatic tiling-candidate generation and tuning on top of the community interface. For most users, the recommended usage is:

- keep the community-style `@triton.autotune` interface;
- set `configs` to `[]`;
- let the Ascend backend generate, filter, benchmark, and cache candidate configurations automatically based on the kernel DSL and runtime shapes.

If your case is not suitable for automatic tiling, you can return to handwritten `triton.Config`.
