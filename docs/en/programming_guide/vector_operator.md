# Vector Operator Development

Vector operators are mainly executed by Vector Cores. Typical examples include element-wise computation, row-wise reduction, type conversion, gather/scatter, masked update, and small fused operators without `tl.dot`. The key is not to create as many grid programs as possible, but to keep the launch close to the number of physical Vector Cores and let each program process multiple tiles in an inner loop.

## Simple Vector Operator Development

For a simple Vector operator, start with the [Vector Addition example](../examples/01_vector_add_example.md) or [`third_party/ascend/tutorials/01-vector-add.py`](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton-ascend/blob/main/third_party/ascend/tutorials/01-vector-add.py). The basic pattern is:

1. Build contiguous offsets for the current tile with `tl.arange`.
2. Use `mask` to guard the tail block and avoid out-of-bounds load/store.
3. Compute the element-wise expression and store the result.
4. If the grid is much larger than the physical core count, set the grid to `num_vectorcore` and process tiles with `range(pid, num_blocks, num_core)` inside the kernel.

The basic kernel structure is as follows:

```python
@triton.jit
def add_kernel(x_ptr, y_ptr, out_ptr, n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr):
    pid = tl.program_id(0)
    num_core = tl.num_programs(0)
    num_blocks = tl.cdiv(n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE)

    for block_idx in range(pid, num_blocks, num_core):
        offsets = block_idx * BLOCK_SIZE + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)
        mask = offsets < n_elements
        x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)
        y = tl.load(y_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)
        tl.store(out_ptr + offsets, x + y, mask=mask)
```

Check these items first:

- **Data type**: Ascend Vector units have different performance for integer types. Prefer `int32` for indices, lengths, and offsets when precision allows. See  [`triton-ascend-ops/tutorial/basic/001-vector_add.zh.md`](https://github.com/Ascend/triton-ascend-ops/blob/main/tutorial/basic/001-vector_add.py) and [`triton-ascend-ops/tutorial/basic/002-vector_cmp.zh.md`](https://github.com/Ascend/triton-ascend-ops/blob/main/tutorial/basic/002-vector_cmp.zh.md).
- **BLOCK_SIZE**: Keep it as large as possible without exceeding UB capacity. If UB overflow occurs, reduce the tile size or split it into sub-blocks.
- **Core count**: An NPU typically has dozens of physical Vector Cores. GPU-style small tiles with very large grids often cause repeated dispatch overhead on NPUs.

## Complex Vector Operator Development

Complex Vector operators usually combine irregular memory access, token reordering, multiple outputs, or long hidden dimensions. Useful references in [Ascend/triton-ascend-ops](https://github.com/Ascend/triton-ascend-ops) include:

- [`tutorial/best_practice/004-gather_scatter.py`](https://github.com/Ascend/triton-ascend-ops/blob/main/tutorial/best_practice/004-gather_scatter.py): an Ascend-friendly implementation of Megablocks gather/scatter/scatter_wgrad.
- [`tutorial/best_practice/005-binned_gather_scatter.py`](https://github.com/Ascend/triton-ascend-ops/blob/main/tutorial/best_practice/005-binned_gather_scatter.py): gather/scatter grouped by expert/bin.
- [`tutorial/best_practice/006-padded_gather_scatter.py`](https://github.com/Ascend/triton-ascend-ops/blob/main/tutorial/best_practice/006-padded_gather_scatter.py): MoE gather/scatter with padding.

Use this structure:

1. **Split outer tasks by physical core count**: use `num_vectorcore` as the grid, with each program handling a segment of indices or tokens.
2. **Split the hidden dimension by UB capacity**: block `NUM_COLUMNS` with `BLOCK_X` and reserve space for double buffers, indices, and temporary tensors.
3. **Use `SUB_BLOCK_SIZE` to batch small-granularity irregular tasks**: load a group of indices at a time, organize them into contiguous temporary blocks in UB, and reduce GM scalar accesses and repeated stores.
4. **Manage UB-local data with extension semantics**: import the extension module with `import triton.language.extra.cann.extension as extension`, then use `extension.insert_slice` to merge multiple rows and `extension.extract_slice` to extract sub-blocks before scattered writes.
5. **Keep a unified mask for tail blocks**: complex gather/scatter involves index masks, column masks, and expert/bin boundaries at the same time; name them separately and combine them only at load/store sites.

Typical UB budgeting:

```python
num_core = get_npu_properties()["num_vectorcore"]
block_size = triton.cdiv(indices_length, num_core)
align_elems = 16
block_x = triton.cdiv(min(num_columns, max_block_x), align_elems) * align_elems
sub_block_size = max((ub_budget - block_x * element_bytes) //
                     (block_x * element_bytes + index_bytes), 1)
```

When the performance of a complex Vector operator is not as expected, first investigate the following:

- Whether the grid is far larger than the number of physical Vector Cores, causing repeated dispatch.
- Whether irregular access can be converted into "bulk load to UB and select in UB".
- Whether the tail axis (the last dimension) is 32B aligned; if not, whether transpose or axis-borrowing transpose can be used to avoid automatic padding.
- Whether `BLOCK_X` and `SUB_BLOCK_SIZE` cause UB overflow or too-small transfer granularity.
